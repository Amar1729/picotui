Known Issues
============

Pay attention to what Unicode font you use in your console. Some Linux
distributions, e.g. Ubuntu, are known to have a broken Unicode font
installed by default, which causes various visual artifacts (specifically,
Ubuntu Mono font isn't really monospace - many Unicode pseudographic
characters have double (or so) width, box-drawing symbols have gaps, etc.)
